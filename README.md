# s1mv
Well without going into too much detail I'm working on a Sonic 1 hack with major metroidvania-ish additions. It's not supposed to be open source but if some of my shitty code takes your fancy I guess you can use it,  but maybe think of crediting me????

# licencing
I'm no expert on all the licences availabale but since this is based on an old version of the Sonic 1 SVN disassembly and Sega never actually relesased any official source I'm guessing this is actually highly illegal ;)

At some point I'll gather up all the various sources for people I need to list for credit, if the top of my head it's people like Mercury, flamewing, Markey Jester, and so on. If I've forgotten you and you want to be listed shoot me an email at crashmahoney@gmail.com
