# s1mv
Well without going into too much detail I'm working on a Sonic 1 hack with major metroidvania-ish additions. It's not supposed to be open source but if some of my shitty code takes your fancy I guess you can have it.

# licencing
I'm no expert on all the licences availabale but since this is based on an old version of the Sonic 1 SVN disassembly and Sega never actually relesased any official source I'm guessing this is actually highly illegal ;)
